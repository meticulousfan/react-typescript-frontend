            </p>

            <p>
                This agreement is governed by New York law, without reference to conflict of laws provisions. You agree
                that you will commence any action against Messy within one (1) year after the cause of action arose;
                otherwise, you agree that your cause of action is barred. With the exception of any claims related to
                the breach (or alleged breach) of any of your warranties and/or representations hereunder, or the
                protection of Messy&rsquo;s intellection property (including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks,
                trade secrets, etc.) any controversy which relates to Messy, the Messy Platform, these TOS, or the
                Privacy Policy will be settled exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a neutral third-party
                arbitrator. This arbitration agreement applies to, among other things and without limitation, disputes
                about the validity, interpretation, or effect of this Agreement or alleged violations of it, any claim
                under federal, state, or local statute, regulation, or common law doctrine. Arbitration shall apply to
                any and all such legal disputes whether asserted against Messy, its affiliates, vendors, consultants,
                service providers, or third-party advertisers, and/or any of their officers, alleged agents or managers,
                directors or other representatives. Arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York. Any
                claims not covered by arbitration will be brought in the courts located in New York County, New York. If
                Messy files an action against you claiming you breached these terms of service and Messy prevails, then
                Messy will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and any damages or other relief Messy may be
                awarded. If you violate these TOS, then we may seek injunctive relief (meaning we may request a court
                order to stop you) or other equitable relief. If we have to provide information in response to a
                subpoena related to your account, then Messy may charge you for Messy&rsquo;s related costs. These fees
                may include attorney and employee time spent retrieving the records, preparing documents, and
                participating in a deposition.
